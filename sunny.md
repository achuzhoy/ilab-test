A short esay about Sunny.

## My dog Sunny.
Sunny, my beloved 6 year-old Wheaten Terrier, is not just a pet but a cherished member of our family. From the moment we brought him home as a playful puppy, he has filled our lives with boundless joy and unconditional love.

Sunny is of mostly white color. He's very friendly. He always barks when someone arrives at our door.
